  fenestrate
  ----------

  Flatten the dependency graph for your NPM package so that it's less likely
  to bump up against the 260-char path limit on Windows. Does not assign blame
  or bloviate about whose responsibility this whole mess is.

  Usage:

  C:/some/long/path/to/module/> fenestrate .

    Updates the package.json file in the current directory and rewrites your
    node_modules directory to
    be shallower.

  Options:

  -u      Defenestrate! Reformats your package.json to be as it once was.

  -U      Defenestrate and also rewrite your node_modules directory to be
          deeper. Completely erase the past, and with it, your regrets.

  -d      Dry run. Describe the changes that would be made to the dependency
          graph, but don't make them.

  -h      Print this help text.
  
  You must always give fenestrate a path. It can be an absolute or relative
  path, but it will never assume you should use the working directory, since
  its operation is (reversibly) destructive.
