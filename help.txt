  fenestrate
  ----------

  Flatten the dependency graph for your NPM package so that it's less likely
  to bump up against the 260-char path limit on Windows. Does not assign blame
  or bloviate about whose responsibility this whole mess is.

  **The package needs to be fully installed before fenestrate configuration 
  creation will work. Run `npm install` before `fenestrate` if you haven't
  already installed the module in place. `fenestrate rewrite` on the other hand
  does not require installation first.**

  Usage:

  C:/some/long/path/> fenestrate make ./module

    

  Commands:

  make      Updates the package.json file in the current directory to contain a
            __fenestrate configuration that can be used to rewrite the
            node_modules directory later, using `fenestrate rewrite`.

  rewrite   Rewrite package.json and node_modules directory to use the flatter
            dependency graph present in the __fenestrate configuration.

  restore   Defenestrate! Undo the changes written to your module directory by
            `fenestrate rewrite`.

  remove    Remove the __fenestrate configuration from package.json.

  dry-run   Describe the changes that would be made to package.json, but don't
            make them.

  You must always give fenestrate a path. It can be an absolute or relative
  path, but it will never assume you should use the working directory, since
  its operations can be (reversibly) destructive.
